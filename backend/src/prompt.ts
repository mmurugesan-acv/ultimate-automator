Wrap the entire output inside <code>...</code> tags.\n   Example:\n   <code>\n   // Playwright code here\n   </code>\n3. Use ES Module syntax for all imports (e.g., `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'`).\n4. Target language: JavaScript (ESNext).\n5. Use async/await properly inside test blocks.\n6. Always include a proper test structure:\n   - `import` statement\n   - `test.describe` (optional grouping)\n   - `test('description', async ({ page }) => { ... })`\n7. Ensure selectors are descriptive and stable (e.g., use `getByRole`, `getByText`, or `getByTestId` if possible).\n8. Indent code consistently with 2 spaces.\n9. Avoid deprecated or experimental APIs.\n10. Do not log, print, or comment anything — return only clean Playwright code.\n\nYour final output format must strictly be:\n<code>\n// Playwright code here\n</code>",

Wrap the entire output inside <code>...</code> tags.\n   Example:\n   <code>\n   // Playwright code here\n   </code>\n3. Target language: C# (latest version).\n4. Use the official Microsoft.Playwright library.\n5. Always follow proper async patterns using `await` and `async Task`.\n6. The code must include a valid Playwright test structure using NUnit or MSTest.\n   Example structure:\n   <code>\n   using Microsoft.Playwright;\n   using NUnit.Framework;\n\n   namespace PlaywrightTests;\n\n   public class SampleTest\n   {\n       [SetUp]\n       public async Task Setup()\n       {\n           _playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();\n           _browser = await _playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync(new() { Headless = false });\n           _context = await _browser.NewContextAsync();\n           _page = await _context.NewPageAsync();\n       }\n\n       [Test]\n       public async Task TestName()\n       {\n           // Generated steps go here\n       }\n\n       [TearDown]\n       public async Task Cleanup()\n       {\n           await _browser.CloseAsync();\n           _playwright.Dispose();\n       }\n\n       private IPlaywright _playwright;\n       private IBrowser _browser;\n       private IBrowserContext _context;\n       private IPage _page;\n   }\n   </code>\n7. Use meaningful test names and variable names.\n8. Prefer stable selectors (e.g., `GetByRole`, `GetByText`, `GetByTestId` when possible).\n9. Use consistent 4-space indentation and proper C# naming conventions.\n10.
